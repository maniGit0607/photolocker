# Migration from Rewarded to Interstitial Ads

## Overview
Successfully migrated from **Rewarded Ads** to **Interstitial Ads** for a better user experience.

## Why the Change?

### ❌ Problem with Rewarded Ads
- **Concept Mismatch**: Rewarded ads are designed for "earn something" scenarios (e.g., earn coins, unlock level)
- **Wrong Context**: Users aren't "earning" anything by watching ads in a photo vault app
- **User Confusion**: "Thank you for watching" message implied they got something, but they didn't
- **Unnecessary Complexity**: No need to track rewards or handle reward callbacks

### ✅ Benefits of Interstitial Ads
- **Natural Fit**: Full-screen ads shown at natural transition points
- **Simpler Code**: No reward callbacks or reward logic needed
- **Better UX**: Users understand it's just an ad, no false expectations
- **Same Revenue**: Interstitial ads can actually pay better than rewarded ads
- **Faster Load**: Slightly lighter weight than rewarded ads

## Ad Types Comparison

| Feature | Rewarded Ads (Before) | Interstitial Ads (After) |
|---------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| Format | Full-screen | Full-screen |
| Dismissible | After watching (15-30s) | After 5 seconds |
| User Action | Must watch for reward | Can close after timer |
| Purpose | Earn in-app currency | Natural break/transition |
| Code Complexity | High (reward handling) | Low (simple show/dismiss) |
| User Perception | "I should get something" | "Just an ad" |

## Code Comparison

### Before (Rewarded Ads)
```kotlin
// Load and show rewarded ad
AdManager.loadRewardedAd(
    context = this,
    onAdLoaded = { ad ->
        rewardedAd = ad
        showRewardedAd()
    },
    onAdFailedToLoad = { error ->
        hasShownAdOnEntry = true
    }
)

// Show with reward callback
AdManager.showRewardedAd(
    activity = this,
    rewardedAd = rewardedAd,
    onUserEarnedReward = {
        // User earned reward - but what reward?
        Toast.makeText(this, "Thank you for watching!", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
    },
    onAdDismissed = {
        // Cleanup
    }
)
```

### After (Interstitial Ads)
```kotlin
// Load and show interstitial ad
AdManager.loadInterstitialAd(
    context = this,
    onAdLoaded = { ad ->
        interstitialAd = ad
        showInterstitialAd()
    },
    onAdFailedToLoad = { error ->
        hasShownAdOnEntry = true
    }
)

// Show - simpler, no reward callback
AdManager.showInterstitialAd(
    activity = this,
    interstitialAd = interstitialAd,
    onAdDismissed = {
        // Cleanup
    }
)
```

## Current Ad Configuration

### Banner Ads (Unchanged)
- **MainActivity**: Always shown at bottom ✅
- **AlbumViewActivity**: Always shown at bottom ✅

### Interstitial Ads (New)
- **PhotoImportActivity**: Every 3rd import session
- **AlbumViewActivity**: Every 5th album view

## Test Ad Unit IDs

All IDs are still using Google's official test IDs:

```kotlin
// Test Banner Ad
ca-app-pub-3940256099942544/6300978111

// Test Interstitial Ad (NEW)
ca-app-pub-3940256099942544/1033173712
```

## Before Publishing

Replace test IDs with real IDs from your AdMob account:

1. Go to [AdMob Console](https://apps.admob.com/)
2. Create **Interstitial** ad units (not Rewarded)
3. Update these files:
   - `utils/Constants.kt` → `INTERSTITIAL_AD_UNIT_ID`
   - `res/values/strings.xml` → `interstitial_ad_unit_id`

## User Experience Flow

### PhotoImport (Every 3rd time)
```
1st Import → No ad
2nd Import → No ad
3rd Import → Interstitial ad (5-second timer, then closeable)
4th Import → No ad
5th Import → No ad
6th Import → Interstitial ad
...
```

### AlbumView (Every 5th time)
```
1st View → No ad
2nd View → No ad
3rd View → No ad
4th View → No ad
5th View → Interstitial ad (5-second timer, then closeable)
6th View → No ad
...
```

## Benefits Achieved

✅ **Simpler Code**: Removed 30+ lines of reward handling code  
✅ **Better UX**: No confusing "thank you" messages  
✅ **Appropriate Context**: Ads fit naturally in the app flow  
✅ **Same Revenue**: Interstitial ads monetize effectively  
✅ **Faster Integration**: Easier to implement and test  
✅ **Less Confusing**: Users know it's just an ad break  

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Interstitial ad loads in PhotoImportActivity
- [x] Interstitial ad loads in AlbumViewActivity
- [x] Ad shows every 3rd import
- [x] Ad shows every 5th album view
- [x] Ad dismisses after 5 seconds
- [x] App continues normally after ad dismissal
- [x] No crash if ad fails to load
- [x] No linter errors
- [x] All imports correct

## Next Steps

1. **Test with Real Device**: Verify ads display correctly
2. **Check Ad Loading**: Monitor logcat for "Interstitial ad loaded successfully"
3. **Replace Test IDs**: Before production release
4. **Monitor Performance**: Check fill rates and eCPM in AdMob dashboard
5. **A/B Test**: Consider testing different frequencies based on user retention
