# Drag Selection Feature

## Overview
Implemented drag selection in the Photo Import screen to allow users to select multiple photos quickly by sliding their finger across them.

## How It Works

### User Experience
1. **Single Tap**: Select/deselect individual photos (existing behavior preserved)
2. **Drag Selection** (NEW):
   - Touch and hold on a photo
   - Slide finger across other photos
   - All photos touched during drag are automatically selected/deselected
   - Release finger to end drag selection

### Smart Selection Mode
The drag selection is context-aware:
- **First photo unselected**: Drag will SELECT all photos touched
- **First photo selected**: Drag will DESELECT all photos touched

This allows users to quickly:
- Select many photos by dragging over unselected photos
- Deselect many photos by dragging over selected photos

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified

#### 1. `GalleryPhotoAdapter.kt`
**New Variables**:
```kotlin
private var isDragSelecting = false
private var dragSelectMode: Boolean? = null
```

**New Methods**:
- `startDragSelection()` - Initiates drag selection mode
- `endDragSelection()` - Ends drag selection and resets state
- `handleDragSelection(position: Int)` - Processes selection for each photo during drag

**Logic Flow**:
1. When drag starts, mode is undetermined (`dragSelectMode = null`)
2. First photo touched sets the mode (select or deselect)
3. Subsequent photos follow the same mode
4. Prevents duplicate toggling on same photo

#### 2. `PhotoImportActivity.kt`
**Added**: `RecyclerView.OnItemTouchListener` in `setupRecyclerView()`

**Touch Event Handling**:
- `ACTION_DOWN`: Records initial touch position
- `ACTION_MOVE`: Detects drag and handles selection for touched items
- `ACTION_UP/CANCEL`: Ends drag selection

**Smart Event Interception**:
- Only intercepts events during active drag
- Allows normal tap events when not dragging
- Consumes touch event after drag to prevent accidental clicks

## Benefits

1. **Faster Selection**: Select 10+ photos in one gesture vs 10 taps
2. **Better UX**: Industry-standard gesture (used by Google Photos, Files apps)
3. **Intuitive**: Works like selecting text or files on desktop
4. **Flexible**: Can select OR deselect in same gesture
5. **Non-Breaking**: Original tap-to-select still works perfectly

## Performance

- ✅ Efficient: Only updates items actually touched during drag
- ✅ No lag: Uses `notifyItemChanged(position)` for targeted updates
- ✅ Smooth scrolling: Works while RecyclerView is scrolled

## Testing Checklist

Test these scenarios:
- [x] Single tap selection/deselection works
- [x] Drag over unselected photos selects them
- [x] Drag over selected photos deselects them
- [x] Mixed drag (starting on selected/unselected)
- [x] Drag while scrolling
- [x] Fast drag across many photos
- [x] Selection count updates correctly
- [x] Import button state updates

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Haptic Feedback**: Add light vibration when crossing each photo
2. **Long Press Delay**: Add slight delay before drag starts (prevents accidental drags)
3. **Auto-scroll**: Scroll RecyclerView when dragging near edges
4. **Visual Trail**: Show selection overlay trail during drag
